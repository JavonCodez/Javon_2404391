        <!-- Favorite Hero Quote/Scene Section -->
        <section class="hero">
            <h2>Favorite Quote from My Hero: My 2nd Eldest Brother Aljerom Scott</h2>
            <p>My 2nd eldest brother has been the unwavering backbone of our family, providing strong emotional and practical support to everyone around him despite not always having the resources or recognition he deserves. Growing up, he stepped up early to help our parents and siblings through tough times, whether it was financial challenges or daily guidance, often putting family needs above his own ambitions. His selflessness shines in how he mentors us—sharing advice on life, work ethic, and balance—while juggling his own responsibilities. He's not a public figure like a celebrity, but his quiet strength and reliability make him my personal hero, teaching me the value of resilience and generosity in building a supportive home.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "The time you have now is more precious than the future you are worrying about."
            </blockquote>
            <p>This quote inspires me because my brother always stresses that constant worry about the future can take a heavy toll on one's body and mind, leading to burnout. Instead, he advocates for proper balance between work and rest, which boosts efficiency and allows you to accomplish more during focused work time. In my academic life, it reinforces my destressing habits that are gaming or sports, helping me stay productive in coding projects without anxiety overwhelming me. As I grow, I aim to become more reliable to help relieve some of that family burden from his shoulders, applying this wisdom to my cybersecurity goals for a balanced, impactful future.</p>
